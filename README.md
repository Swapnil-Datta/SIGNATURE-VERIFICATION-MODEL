This project focuses on developing an advanced signature recognition system using DenseNet Convolutional Networks. The model is designed to accurately distinguish between genuine and forged signatures by leveraging key features such as high-density variation and cross-over loops.
Key Features:

DenseNet Architecture: Utilized for robust feature extraction and improved accuracy in signature classification.
Preprocessing Techniques: Includes denoising to enhance image quality and Hilditch thinning to simplify signature structures.
Performance: Achieved 97% accuracy, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness in real-world authentication scenarios.
This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation needed to replicate and understand the methodology used in this project.
